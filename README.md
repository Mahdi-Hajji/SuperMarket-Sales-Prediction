# SuperMarket-Sales-Prediction
## 1. Introduction
### •	Objective: 
The objective of this project is to predict total sales based on various retail features using machine learning models. By leveraging historical data, the goal is to provide insights that can aid in decision-making and planning for retail businesses.
### •	Dataset:
The dataset used consists of transactional data from a retail store, including features such as unit price, quantity sold, tax, customer demographics, and payment methods. The target variable is the total sales generated per transaction.
### 
•	Tools Used: Python was used as the primary programming language, with libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, scikit-learn for machine learning modeling, matplotlib for visualizations, and seaborn for enhanced data visualization capabilities.
## 2. Data Preprocessing
### •	Data Cleaning: 
The dataset underwent thorough cleaning to handle missing values, correct data types, and identify and address outliers that could affect model performance.
### •	Feature Selection:
Relevant features were selected based on their potential impact on predicting total sales. Features such as unit price, quantity, tax, and customer demographics were considered critical.
### •	Feature Engineering:
Additional features were derived to enhance the predictive power of the models. For example, categorical variables like customer type, gender, product line, and payment method were transformed using one-hot encoding to make them suitable for modeling.
## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### •	Statistical Analysis:
Descriptive statistics were computed to summarize the dataset, including mean, median, standard deviation, and range for numerical features. This provided insights into the central tendency and spread of the data.
### •	Visualizations: 
Various plots such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots were used to visualize the distribution of numerical variables, identify patterns, correlations, and potential outliers. This exploration helped in understanding the data's structure and relationships.
## 4. Model Development
### •	Model Selection:
Two models were evaluated for predicting total sales: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression. The choice between models was based on their ability to minimize Mean Squared Error (MSE) during model evaluation.
### •	Model Training: 
The selected model (e.g., Random Forest Regression) was trained on the preprocessed dataset. This involved splitting the data into training and testing sets to assess model performance accurately.
### •	Model Evaluation:
Performance metrics such as MSE were calculated to quantify the model's accuracy in predicting total sales. Residual analysis was conducted to examine the distribution of errors and assess model assumptions.
## 5. Results and Analysis
### •	Performance Metrics:
Comparison of MSE between Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression to determine the superior model for predicting total sales.
### •	Prediction Accuracy:
Visualizations depicting predicted versus actual values to illustrate how well the model predictions align with real-world data.
### •	Prediction Errors:
Histograms and scatter plots showing the distribution of prediction errors, helping to identify any systematic biases or outliers in the model predictions.
